  <h1>Chemistry page</h1>
  <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol such as Fe for iron, H for Hydrogen, and O for Oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
  <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
  <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
  <h6>2H <sub>2</sub>  + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</h6>
  <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <var>(H<sub>2</sub>)</var> and oxygen gas <var>(O<sub>2</sub>)</var> to form water <var>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</var>.</p>
  <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
  <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
  <p><sub>Subscript</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
